# Wallet-rs

Wallet-rs is a Rust implementation of the [Universal Wallet Specification](https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet), (currently) focusing on simplicity and correctness. Currently it implements a small subset of the described functionality, namely key generation, storage, operations (signing, key agreement, decryption) and export of public key material. It is currently intended and used for a secure key management solution for use in SSI agents in mobile devices, web services and browsers.
